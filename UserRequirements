The purpose of this software is to provide a tracking system for PCs, laptops, switches, hubs, routers, servers, smartphones and tablets (all will be referred to as workstations) that are a part of a network. The specifications vary based on the type of workstation. The location and specs of each workstation will be stored in a database. The software will allow repair tickets to be generated for each workstation and the repair tickets will be given a time for completion. The database will keep track of all in progress and completed repair tickets. The software will also generate reporting information. The reporting information will show a history of parts for workstations, projected repairs for parts, and the yearly cost of repairs. Administrators of the software will be able to create software users with varying amount of permissions. The software will be able to perform backups of the database as well.
